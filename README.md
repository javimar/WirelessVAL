Wireless Public Networks of the City of Valencia

Welcome to WireLess VAL.

This useful application shows all the public free wireless networks provided by the Valencia City Council. The app allows to geolocate each one of them.

A detail screen is also provided to rate and comment about the Wi-Fi as well as seeing a dedicated map of its location.

App is available in both Spanish and English. It is Jetpack compose 100% with Material 3 theming, Ktor for network request, SQLDelight as database and follows a clean architecture. 

If you have time, take a look at how the app was migrated from old Java to modern Compose. Check out the java branch for that :-)
